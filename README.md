<h1 style="color:pink;">Hogwarts API - Generating Pairs</h1> 

<h2 style="color:pink;">Description</h2> 
You are a hogwarts teacher doing a lesson with the whole of one house e.g the whole of Hufflepuff.
You are doing a dualing task with the students in pairs.
The code takes the whole list of Hogwarts students and pairs up the students that you are teaching that day.
You will be provided with a file containing the pairs of students ready for your lesson.

Here is a copy of the API link:  https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters/students

Below is the main thoughts/steps of what I was going to go through to get my list:

1. Is student in that house?
2. Is the student still alive?
3. hogwarts student = true 
4. Prints list of name vs name

<h2 style="color:pink;">Usage</h2>

You will need to import requests and import random in order to run the code.
When you run the code it will provide you with a pairs.txt file which will contain the data.
